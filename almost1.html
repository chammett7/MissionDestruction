<h1 class="animated slideInDown"> Almost...</h1>
<p class="animated slideInUp"> You were on the right track by cutting the power; however, E-waste is highly dangerous
    for the ocean. All the plastic and metal of your equipment will kill a significant portion of wildlife. The
    chemicals that leak from batteries into the water and soil turn the ocean into a landfill on its own. The mission
    will be successful; however, the planet in-turn would be destroyed. Batteries and electronics are the main sources
    of harmful metals in our water and soil. </p>
